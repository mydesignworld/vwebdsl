    <p class="text-justified text-primary display-4">Our Design System Library is a collection of pre-built, reusable components, patterns, guidance, and code that allow us to build consistent digital experiences faster that support best case user interface design and development. Defining the purpose and style of every component, whether that be colour, shape, type, icons, space, and motion is essential to creating a clear and usable UI, togther with guidelines that govern hierarchy  provide for a consistent and a seamless and delightful user experience. </p>
    <p class="text-justified pt-2">Without standards, decisions around UI can become arbitrary. Not only does this not scale, but inconsistent interface conventions hinder usability and create frustrating user experiences. When CSS for countless unique interface elements and their interactions increase, so does cognitive load and page weight. It can also create conflicting or duplicated code, potentially breaking our product.</p>
    <p class="text-justified">In essence a design system reduces design debt, accelerates the development process and builds a bridge between design and development teams. Its greatly improves efficiency by preventing duplication and scratch building through the use of reusable componenets, saving time and money.</p>
